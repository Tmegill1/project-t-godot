class_name Difficulty

## Difficulty tiers. Pure data, like the rest of data/.
##
## Difficulty is a PARAMETER in this project, never a global. Waves and the
## harness take a tier argument; nothing reads a mutable singleton. That is
## what keeps sim/ pure and keeps Harness.run_wave's guarantee - same input,
## same result - which is the property every balance claim here rests on.
##
## Normal is the exact identity transform. Every measured number in this
## project describes Normal, so the existing suite doubles as the regression
## net for this file: if a Normal multiplier drifts, something else fails.

const NORMAL := &"normal"
const HARD := &"hard"
const NIGHTMARE := &"nightmare"

## Easiest first. Task 2's monotonicity test walks this in order.
const ORDER: Array[StringName] = [NORMAL, HARD, NIGHTMARE]

## The multiplier keys, as distinct from starting_lives (an int) and label
## (a string). Tests iterate this rather than restating the list.
const KEYS: Array[StringName] = [
	&"count_multiplier",
	&"interval_multiplier",
	&"health_multiplier",
	&"speed_multiplier",
	&"gold_multiplier",
]

## Which lever attacks what, and why these and not others:
##
##   interval_multiplier  spawn spacing, so CONCURRENCY. The sharpest lever
##                        available. Measurement established that board
##                        COVERAGE binds, not hit points; halving the interval
##                        doubles the crowd one tower must cover without
##                        touching a single enemy stat.
##   count_multiplier     enemies per wave. Same constraint, blunter, and it
##                        compounds with the accumulating composition.
##   health_multiplier    hit points. Proven WEAK ALONE - wave-20 health x11.5
##                        leaked zero against a maxed board - but real in
##                        combination, because it lengthens the window during
##                        which concurrency matters.
##   speed_multiplier     time under fire. The other side of coverage: less
##                        time in range is the same as less range.
##   gold_multiplier      the board a player can afford. Indirect, strong.
##   starting_lives       forgiveness. The only lever a player feels at once.
##
## SMALLER is harsher for interval_multiplier and gold_multiplier. Larger is
## harsher for the other three. The monotonicity test encodes both directions.
